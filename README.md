# Password Strength Checker

> Updated: 1/10/2023

## About

This program checks the strength of inputted passwords by analyzing their length and character composition for academic purposes. Concepts exercised include:

- functions
- file operations
- looping until valid inputs received
- User input
- Colored text output
- String analysis

## Implementation

The project is implemented in a single file written in the Java programming language.

## Dependencies

This program relies on a txt file with the name "common_passwords.txt". You may download a publicly available database, rename the file and place it in the same directory as the program.

## Reference

A common password .txt database can be downloaded from: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt

## Disclaimer/ Warning

Password strength estimations made by the program are just suggestions and may not be conducive to real world results. Do not rely on this tool when creating your own passwords. Use for learning purposes only.
